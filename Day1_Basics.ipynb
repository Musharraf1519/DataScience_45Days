    "# \t1. Print statement\n",
    "print(\"Hello, Data Science!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# \t2. Variables and data types\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a variable?\n",
    "# Think of a variable like a label or box where you store some information (data) to use later. You can give this box a name, and put different kinds of things inside — like numbers, words, or yes/no values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Types: The kind of things you store\n",
    "# \t• int = whole numbers (like 1, 5, 100)\n",
    "# \t• float = decimal numbers (like 3.14, 0.5)\n",
    "# \t• string (str) = words or text (like \"hello\", \"data\")\n",
    "# \t• boolean (bool) = true/false values\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code example, explained line by line\n",
    "age = 25                   # This means “store the number 25 in a box called 'age'”\n",
    "height = 5.8               # Store the decimal number 5.8 in a box called 'height'\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"             # Store the word Alice as text in a box called 'name'\n",
    "is_student = True          # Store the true/false value True in a box called 'is_student'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(name, \"is\", age)     # Print out the value of name, then the word “is”, then the value of age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Try it yourself — practice exercises:\n",
    "# \t1. Change the value of age to your own age, and run the code again.\n",
    "# \t2. Create a new variable called favorite_food and assign a string value like \"pizza\".\n",
    "# \t3. Print a sentence like: print(\"My favorite food is\", favorite_food)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# \t3. Basic math operations\n",
    "# What it is:\n",
    "# Python can do math just like a calculator — add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find remainders.\n",
    "# Code examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "print(a + b)  # Addition: prints 13\n",
    "print(a - b)  # Subtraction: prints 7\n",
    "print(a * b)  # Multiplication: prints 30\n",
    "print(a / b)  # Division: prints 3.3333 (float result)\n",
    "print(a % b)  # Modulus: prints 1 (remainder of 10/3)\n",
    "# Practice:\n",
    "# \t• Change the values of a and b to any numbers you like and run all these operations again.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \t4. If / Else conditionals\n",
    "# What it is:\n",
    "# Use if statements to make decisions in your code, like checking if something is true or false and doing different things based on that.\n",
    "# Code example:\n",
    "\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "# Explanation:\n",
    "# \t• if age >= 18: checks if age is at least 18.\n",
    "# \t• If true, it prints “You are an adult.”\n",
    "# \t• Otherwise (else), it prints “You are a minor.”\n",
    "# Practice:\n",
    "# \t• Change the age variable to other numbers and see how output changes.\n",
    "# \t• Write an if/else that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "# \t5. Loops — For Loop and While Loop\n",
    "# What is a loop?\n",
    "# Loops let you repeat code multiple times automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For loop example:\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\t# • This prints numbers 0 to 4 (5 times).\n",
    "\t# • range(5) creates numbers 0,1,2,3,4.\n",
    "\n",
    "# While loop example:\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1   # same as count = count + 1\n",
    "# \t• Repeats while the condition count < 5 is true.\n",
    "# \t• Prints numbers 0 to 4.\n",
    "# Practice:\n",
    "# \t• Write a for loop that prints all even numbers between 2 and 20.\n",
    "# \t• Write a while loop that counts down from 10 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t# 7. Functions\n",
    "# What is a function?\n",
    "# Functions are reusable blocks of code that do one task. You give them input (arguments), and they can give you output.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\", name)\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")    # Calls the function with \"Alice\"\n",
    "# \t• def starts the function definition.\n",
    "# \t• name is the input parameter.\n",
    "# \t• Inside, it prints a greeting.\n",
    "# Function with return value example:\n",
    "def add_numbers(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "result = add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
    "print(result)   # Prints 8\n",
    "# Practice:\n",
    "# \t• Write a function that takes a number and prints whether it is even or odd.\n",
    "# \t• Write a function that multiplies two numbers and returns the result.\n"
